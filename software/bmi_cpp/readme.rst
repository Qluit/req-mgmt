BMI computation in C++
======================

The BMI computation is done in the 'bmi_calculator.cpp' file. 
The tests are in the 'test_bmi_calculator.cpp' file.
The tests use the `Catch2 framework <https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2>`_.
The report.xml in JUnit format can be generated by running:

.. code-block:: shell

  g++ -std=c++11 -o test_bmi_calculator test_bmi_calculator.cpp
  ./test_bmi_calculator -r junit >> report.xml
  rm test_bmi_calculator
